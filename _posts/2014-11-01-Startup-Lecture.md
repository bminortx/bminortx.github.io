I currently TA for an Intro to Computer Science class at CU Boulder. I dreaded it at first, but I've grown to enjoy the job; it's nice to see students painfully struggle through the things that tormented me in undergrad (though I still offer a helping hand). This Halloween, instead of helping them with their code, I was offered to give a lecture on my experiences in the startup community.

I jumped at the opportunity, and created a talk that I hoped did two things:

1. Give a good case study of what a startup really is through my own company
2. Offer advice that could be applied to any entrepreneur.

My lovely girlfriend did a wonderful thing and recorded the whole lecture. The real take-home message: Startup life is your life until your startup finds a life of its own. No startup is the same, so it takes all your energy to get it right. Check out the whole 24-minute talk below; I think it has some good points, though I might have a slight bias...
