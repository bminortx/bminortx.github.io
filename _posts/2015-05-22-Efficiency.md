title:  "Efficiency"

For the last year of my life, I've been looking for methods to spend my time more efficiently. It's been incredibly enlightening, and I have in fact become a more efficient person, but I'm not interested in compiling a list of tips and tricks letting anyone complete their todo list into a day (at least not here). Instead, with this year behind me, I find myself asking the question, "Is it worth it?" This question seems obvious, but I've found two very different answers for myself, and neither one is entirely right.

To give you a better idea of why I even started this search for efficiency in the first place: it was borne of necessity. A year ago, I was still part of both a PhD program and a company that I helped found. As you might imagine, this was not the easiest thing for me to do, especially given how inexperienced I actually was at both (something I didn't dare admit to myself at the time). Now that I've dropped one and devoted myself to the other, I have a clearer head about the whole thing, which is why I'm allowing myself this little bit of introspection.

###First Answer###

The engineer in me says, "Of course". Saving time is a good thing, because it gives you time for... other things that take up time. But more intelligent things. If you're spending a day on some stupid, repetitive task, it makes sense to automate that task, or find a better way of doing it, so that you never have to [waste your time again](https://xkcd.com/1445/). This is actually the premise of a lot of engineering: if you're doing the same thing over and over again, you're probably doing it wrong.

This line of reasoning appeals to my nature in so many ways; I can't tell whether I'm a computer scientist because of this philosophy, or I have it the other way around, but it's a big factor in my attitude towards work. My worst days - at work or otherwise - are when I'm faced with a task that I don't know how to optimize. This goes for anything: gaps in my knowledge that prevent my code from compiling; a paper that I can't speedread (I'm looking at you, two-column small font pdf); waiting at the DMV.

The last one is sort of a cop-out, but you get the idea.

So, according to the engineer in me, this process has fulfilled my every dream. There's always a better way to do things, I understand, but one of my biggest accomplishments this year is that I can now identify and implement these better methods of efficiency, efficiently. I just don't feel like I read faster, type faster, learn faster: I _know_. And the best part is I still have room to grow.

###Second Answer### 

The 23-year-old that I actually am says "Oh god, please stop working." This, unlike the first answer, is not in my nature _at all_. I can't just not do anything (which might be obvious by now). However, My 22-year-old self didn't realize that doing things faster is not an excuse to do more things, faster. This struggle is best demonstrated by, what else, one of my tools for efficiency. Toggl is a time tracker that I use during work days, to see where I spent my time most (or didn't). Here's my week from the 2nd - 8th of March 2015:
