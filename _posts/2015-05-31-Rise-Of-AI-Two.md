When I started my PhD, I had a big misconception about what the phrase 'state-of-the-art' meant. In my mind, a state-of-the-art vehicle was the Mach 5. A state-of-the-art facility was one with a lot of glass walls, researchers in white coats, and floating computers that gave sassy, yet sage, advice. _State-of-the-Art_ was synonymous with _The Future_.

I have since learned that this is not correct.

Not entirely, at least. For me, The Future was complete. Things worked. Technologies were flawless. Since I've become involved in robotics, I know now that State-of-the-Art, especially in these fields, is often far from achieving this lofty goal. Things break. Solutions are hacky.

This is in no way a criticism of the robotics community; the science that has been produced in the past couple of years is _amazing_, and often a strong prediction of what The Future will hold. Yet the fact of the matter is, creating robotic systems is hard. Design is hard. Perception is hard. Path planning is hard. These are all active fields of research, and there is no perfect solution to any of them. 

However, research and the real world often tend to be two very different things. AI is big business, and this economic boom has accelerated the development of new technologies. These, in turn, create even greater economic demand. It's a cycle that we're trying to harness at [Replica Labs](http://www.replicalabs.com): business begetting tech, begetting business. However, as discussed in [Part I](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2015/05/26/Rise-Of-AI-One/), important players in this field (research and business alike) are voicing real fears about the pace of progress, mainly that we're going too fast to truly understand [the implications of what we are creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PLvdmifDSk). To better know these claims, I believe it's important to realize the state of AI now; that way, we can make a more educated prediction on what we might realistically expect.

## The Scary (Awesome) Part: Machine Learning and Big Data ##

In my mind, the development of advanced machine learning is one of the most transformative achievements of our time. Put simply: machine learning is magic. It makes sense of vast amounts of data for use in more abstract processes. In other words, machine learning can use all of those cat videos on YouTube to figure out for itself what a 'cat' is, and then use that info to identify cats in the future. I hope this doesn't sound too simplistic, because the process of teaching a computer 'cat'-ness is difficult, to say the least (though [Google did exactly that](http://research.google.com/archive/unsupervised_icml2012.html)).

The State-Of-The-Art here lies in a paper by Alex Krizhevsky called ["ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Nets"](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf). Neural nets are a statistical method of shaking out patterns from large swaths of data, the design of which was originally inspired by the way your optic nerves communicate images to the brain. In it's most basic form, it's using a non-linear equation of some sort to fit an input to an output:

In a way, AI and humans are redefining one another as developments continue.


## The (Realistic) Future of AI ##

SUMMARY: Worry about dumb AI, not smart AI. Overreaching leads to downfall.
