When I started my PhD, I had a big misconception about what the phrase 'state-of-the-art' meant. In my mind, a state-of-the-art vehicle was the Mach 5. A state-of-the-art facility was one with a lot of glass walls, researchers in white coats, and floating computers that gave sassy, yet sage, advice. _State-of-the-Art_ was synonymous with _The Future_.

I have since learned that this is not correct.

Not entirely, at least. For me, The Future was complete. Things worked. Technologies were flawless. Since I have begun to devote myself to the study of robotics and AI[^1][^2], I know now that State-of-the-Art, especially in these fields, is often far from achieving this lofty goal. Things break. Solutions are hacky.

This is in no way a criticism of the robotics community; the science that has been produced in the past couple of years is _amazing_, and often a strong prediction of what The Future will hold. Yet the fact of the matter is, creating robotic systems is hard. Design is hard. Perception is hard. Path planning is hard. These are all active fields of research, and there is no perfect solution to any of them. 

However, research and the real world often tend to be two very different things. AI is big business, and this economic boom has accelerated the development of new technologies. These, in turn, create even greater economic demand. It's a cycle that we're trying to harness at [Replica Labs](http://www.replicalabs.com): business begetting tech, begetting business. However, as discussed in [Part I](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2015/05/26/Rise-Of-AI-One/), important players in this field (research and business alike) are voicing real fears about the pace of progress, mainly that we're going too fast to truly understand [the implications of what we are creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PLvdmifDSk). To better know these claims, I believe it's important to realize the state of AI now; that way, we can make a more educated prediction on what we might realistically expect.

## The Current State of AI ##

AI is not just one subject, but rather a large category for several different systems, each of which can (and often do) interact with each other to complete a task, but are all important on their own. I've restricted my search to the most rapidly-evolving fields of research, since those are the areas that are probably causing all of the fuss.

Machine Learning is magic.
