When I started my PhD, I had a big misconception about what the phrase 'state-of-the-art' meant. In my mind, a state-of-the-art vehicle, for instance, was the Mach 5. A state-of-the-art facility was one with a lot of glass walls, researchers in white coats, and floating computers that gave sassy, yet sage, advice. _State-of-the-Art_ was synonymous with _The Future_.

I have since learned that this is not correct.

Not entirely, at least. For me, _The Future_ was complete. Things worked. Technologies were flawless.

Since I have begun to devote my life to the study of robotics[^1], I know now that _State-of-the-Art_, especially in robotics, is often far from achieving this lofty goal. Things break. Solutions are hacky.
