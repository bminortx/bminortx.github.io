A couple of the Occipital team got together and hacked on a fun little VR project we like to call "VR project". Actually, the name was one of the sticking points, but the mechanics were not. It was basically a golf game in space; shoot your satellite through the gravity wells of the surrounding planets to make it to the goal. For having limited experience with the whole thing, we collectively did a pretty good job in ~6 hours (though I got there late... classic). Check out the project here!
