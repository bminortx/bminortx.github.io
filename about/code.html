		<h4>ARPG Code</h4>
		<p class="square-small text-justify">The ARPG (now at CU Boulder) designed their codebase from the ground up; I was privileged enough to work on this system in its relative infancy. I contributed to <a href="https://github.com/arpg/SceneGraph" target="_blank">SceneGraph</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arpg/Node" target="_blank">Node</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/arpg/HAL" target="_blank">HAL</a>, and completely took apart Nima Keivan's <a href="https://github.com/arpg/CarPlanner" target="_blank">CarPlanner</a> to complete my research. I designed <a href="https://github.com/arpg/simba" target="_blank">SimBA</a>, a robotics physics simulator, from the ground up using the Bullet Physics Engine to enable the lab to simulate common robotic conditions using real-time physics. SimBA is the cumulation of almost all of the available libraries in ARPG, so maintaining it became a full-time job. That being said, it worked wonders for autonomous vehicle testing. But who am I to say.</p>
		<h4><a href="http://bminortx.github.io/SimLAB/" target="_blank">SimLAB</a></h4>
		<p class="square-small text-justify">SimLAB was the precursor to SimBA, while I was trying my skills at both Bullet Physics and MATLAB. It was a wrapper of the Bullet Physics Engine using MATLAB, for faster iterations in research. It lingered in my directory, all alone, for quite some time; since I was proud of the work I did, I decided to put it up on GitHub and open it up to community development. Since then, I'm happy to say that it's come in handy for a good number of people. I'm going to be picking it back up and improving a couple of things soon, now that I sort of know what I'm doing.</p>
