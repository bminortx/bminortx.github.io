            was for a technology I called Replica, which created 3D printable

            By the end of this summer, we hope to have created software that will
            do an amazing thing: turn any smartphone into a 3D scanner. This

              Rendor</a>,
            won't be the first app of its kind, but with the science that
            we're throwing behind it, it will be the most powerful.
            Beta testing for Rendor is now open for sign-up; make your

                    there's not a narrow list of duties for my position. I work
                    closely with the team on developing software and
                    dreaming up better technology, and actively recruit new
                    and talented developers. I also serve as the public
                    face of the company, having designed both the

                  <h4>STEP Physical Assistant in Materials Science</h4>
                  <em>Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC
                    (January – December 2012)</em>
                  <p class="square-small text-justify">As a STEP
                    Assistant, it was my duty to maintain and organize
                    lab equipment and research tools. In the course of
                    my time there, I learned to operate the lab's laser
                    and optic systems, both 355nm and 266nm beams. I had
                    two main research goals: the accurate machining of
                    research materials and creation of successful laser
                    direct-write (LDW) samples for the NRL.

                  <p class="square-small text-justify">I acted as a
                    resource and mentor to students in my dormitory, as
                    well as helped the University at large through
                    service and event coordination. The position was
                    less RA, and more guidance counselor to younger
                    students.</p>

                  <em>Callahan and Associates, Washington DC (March -
                    August 2011)</em>
                  <p class="square-small text-justify">I learned how
                    to use and troubleshoot Callahan's patented software
                    program Peer to Peer, which processed and presented
                    data from United States Credit Unions to CEOs and
                    CFOs, allowing for more effective analysis. Working
                    with Peer to Peer helped me gain experience with
                    Salesforce, SQL Server Management Studio, and

                    as soon as I graduated, under the
                    guidance of Prof. Gabe Sibley. While here, I was
                    involved in robotic path planning and computer
                    vision studies, with the goal of improving the
                    autonomous navigation of an RC car. It was a
                    formative and challenging year. In the summer of
                    2014, Prof. Sibley, ARPG, and I transferred to CU
                    Boulder to develop the Computer Vision program

                    valuable experience, and helped me conceptualize
                    several core concepts in statistics, control,
                    inference, learning, and big data analysis. I highly
                    recommend the sources listed above to any researcher
                    in the field; I took so many notes that I thought it

                    help me organize everything. Maybe one day I'll

                  <h4>Replica Labs and Rendor</h4>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                    I have devoted the last year of my life to creating a
                    software-only solution to 3D scanning. If this seems like
                    a simple task... it is not. Mainly because software is not
                    the only thing one does when building a software company.
                    I've:
                    <br><br>
                    constructed the company websites | set the pipeline for
                    Rendor through Django database systems, various Android
                    programs | constructed core algorithms to work our science |
                    orchestrated a beta rollout for Rendor testing |
                    kept interested users and investors updated through the
                    company blog | recruited and trained team members from
                    management to dev | pitched and demoed every which where.
                    <br><br>
                    There's more there, I guarantee it. I'm just exhausted
                    looking at that list. This is not to say that I didn't have
                    plenty of help; I credit the Replica team to all of the
                    success that we've exerienced. It's just shocking to see how
                    much actually goes into starting a company, even when one
                    has such amazing support.
                    <br><br>
                    This sort of thinking has brought to life my new interest:
                    management and company structure. I realize that it sounds
                    like the dryest subject in time and space, but company
                    culture in practice and theory is so much more important
                    than one might initially expect, and its especially true
                    when one finds themselves in a position to shape that, as
                    I find myself now. Still a long way to go now, I think...

                  <p class="text-justify">My robotics research
                    primarily focused on path planning using autonomous
                    vehicles; though I didn't publish anything, I performed intensive
                    research on planning using deep learning techniques and RRT
                    modifications. I steeped myself in both planning and
                    computer vision literature; most of this experience has been
                    applied to developing the Rendor infrastructure.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">The ARPG (now at CU
                    Boulder) designed their codebase from the ground up; I was
                    privileged enough to work on this system in its relative
                    infancy. I contributed

                    designed <a href="https://github.com/arpg/simba"

                    a robotics physics simulator, from
                    the ground up using the Bullet Physics Engine to enable the
                    lab to simulate common robotic conditions using real-time
                    physics. SimBA is the cumulation of almost all of the
                    available libraries in ARPG, so maintaining it became a
                    full-time job. That being said, it worked wonders for
                    autonomous vehicle testing. But who am I to say.</p>

                    to SimBA, while I was trying my skills at both Bullet Physics
                    and MATLAB. It was a wrapper of the Bullet Physics Engine
                    using MATLAB, for faster iterations in research. It lingered
                    in my directory, all alone, for quite some time; since I was
                    proud of the work I did, I decided to put it up on GitHub and
                    open it up to community development. Since then, I'm happy to
                    say that it's come in handy for a good number of people. I would
                    love to see it become a full-fledged scientific tool, but things
                    are a bit hectic for me to work on it right now. Volunteers are

                  <p class="square-small text-justify">I became involved in
                    robotics research in the Fall of 2012; before that, I had
                    been intensely focused on materials science and
                    nanotechnology. This interest brought me to the NRL, working
                    under Dr. Alberto Pique. Through application of Laser
                    Direct-Write manufacturing, a technique developed through
                    the NRL, I performed and became educated in both battery and
                    electronics manufacturing. I also used and calibrated laser
                    optic systems, profilometers, microscopes, UV lamps,
                    spectrometers, and other vital pieces of research equipment
                    for application in various projects.  </p>

                    (GWU), Prof. David Nagel (GWU), Prof. Scott Mathews
                    (Catholic University). We used a femtosecond laser to create
                    laser-induced periodic surface structures, i.e. LIPSS, on
                    samples of palladium for potential materials
                    applications. LIPSS have been the subject of several
                    interesting case studies involving the micro-structuring and
                    modification of materials. When shot with a short-pulse
                    laser beam, a metal will bend and shape its surface
                    according to the beams parameters, creating a periodic
                    surface structure. We analyzed the results of femtosecond
                    interaction with Palladium using a scanning electron
                    microscope and MATLAB. The experimental parameters were the
                    fluence of the laser and number of shots on a particular
                    spot. LIPSS were not produced with our chosen parameters,
                    but other structures were created that could still be of use
                    in experiments influenced by surface modification, such as
                    deuterium loading.</p>

                      Cream Problem</em>: Physicists love coffee. Hot coffee, to
                    be exact. Looking at our too-often lukewarm mugs, GWU's
                    Prof. Gerald Feldman and I wondered: what's the best way to
                    mix cream in one's coffee to achieve the hottest temperature
                    for the longest time? This was an elegant experiment
                    demonstrating Newton's Law of Cooling at a basic level. I
                    used Logger Pro to demonstrate this effect on a cup of hot
                    coffee (hot water) mixed with cool cream (cold water).  This
                    project was presented at SESAPS 2011, as “The Coffee and
                    Cream Dilemma”. I obtained a student award from the APS to
                    travel to the conference in Roanoke, VA to present the
                    poster.</p>
