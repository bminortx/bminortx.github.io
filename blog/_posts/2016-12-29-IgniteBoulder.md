Have you ever experienced [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)? It happens to PhD students a lot: the feeling that all of one's accomplishments are the byproduct of luck and happenstance, not the skill and hard work that one actually put in. It's most acute when you've devoted yourself to one thing, where turning back would mean years of your life wasted<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Or feel wasted, at least. Very rarely is that true.</span></span>. 

I used to experience this, a bit, when I was in my own PhD program, and then when I was part of Replica Labs. In my case, sadly, I wasn't making this feeling up. My Impostor Syndrome was confirmed by a veritable panel of experts, and it took everything I had to overcome the hole I had dug myself into. It was one of the most stressful, make-or-break moments of my life, and I had to fight to develop something that I never even knew was lacking: my memory. My Ignite Boulder talk, here below, tells that story.

I will admit, I had never been to an Ignite show before I was _in_ an Ignite show, but the premise was always curious to me: speakers have 5 minutes to tell the best story they can. It doesn't necessarily have to be about tech, or startups, or be inspirational in any way (though most are), but they should have a message or a moral of some sort.

I didn't have anything clear in mind when I was thinking about my talk; I had talked about VR before, and my PhD experiences were somewhat interesting, but nothing about them was particularly... gripping, at least not to a large audience. Or, I could have talked about the time that I broke my face in a mountain biking accident, but what was the moral there? That I do stupid things sometimes?<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">This happened. Intelligence comes in many forms. My form is just a little more beat up than most.</span></span>.

What I eventually settled on, the talk you see here, is not the classic tale of the hero, though I would love for that to be true. It's more like the parable of the Prodigal Son tale: coming back to what knowledge truly is after years of wandering through the intellectual wilderness. Or at least, that's how it felt for me, haha. I'm sure my telling doesn't get nearly that dramatic. I hope you enjoy it, though. I thank Ignote Boulder for giving me the chance to tell a small part of my own story.
