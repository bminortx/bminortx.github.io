A couple of months ago, through the twists and turns of the internet, I was led to this video:

I consider myself a bit of a DIYer. I like trying new things, but only if they serve some sort of purpose in my life. It's ususally not hard to find a purpose, granted; even mundane things have a point. As soon as I saw this video, though, I decided that I needed to do this, for no better reason than... well, it looked freakin' cool.

I've since learned that Hydrographics are _the_ way to paint industrial and intricate patterns. With a clean part, activated hydrographics will adhere instantly and create a seamless design of the maker's choosing. The patterns come in thin rolls of film, which are cut and sizes according ot the surface area of the part. Thus, my first task was choosing what I was going to paint.

I had painted my{% _footnote 2|Dad's %} NES before, but that had been the first time I had really done anything with spraypaint, so the final product looked less professional than I had intended{% _footnote 3|though still not bad for a first time!%}{% _footnote 4|...other than accidentally spraypainting my landlord's driveway a nice shade of gold. %}. Here's a snapshot of the console back from 2014:

I decided it was time for an upgrade, and hydrographics was going to provide the means. One roll of patterned film from [Hydrodip, the company I sourced from,](http://www.hydrodip.com/) provided 18 sqft to work with. So, naturally, I got three rolls. 

Hydrographics are used a lot for camouflage parts (Read: guns, things that go on guns), but I didn't really want to lose my NES on the forest floor, so I went with more conservative patterns{% _footnote 5|Though the blue one is "Splatter Camo". Not sure what that's supposed to hide one from.%}.

Marble was for my NES; Burlwood for the N64; Splatter for the Gamecube. I thought they all fit, in their own way. I had disassembled the NES before (as seen by my previous paint job), but I hadn't tried to take apart the N64 or Gamecube prior to this. It proved harder than I anticipated; both the N64 and Gamecube have specially designed screws that you can't unscrew without a [Nintento bit](https://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=security+bit+n64&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=153654209207&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8449694122684483223&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9060040&hvtargid=kwd-34680610175&ref=pd_sl_9cemn1qmgt_b). I thought I had one of these from when I cleaned the game cartrdges, but... a man can only track so many pieces of hardware, you know?  Luckily for me, the _controllers_ don't suffer from this construction, so I decided to work on those instead.

After prepping the surfaces with plenty of spraypaint, all that was left was to dip! I outsourced a large bucket that would fit the submerged parts, and went for my first attempt with one of the
