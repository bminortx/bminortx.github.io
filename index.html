	<p class="square text-justify">I recently transferred from GWU to the University of Colorado at Boulder, originally pursuing my PhD in Computer Science. Since the move to Boulder, however, my life has been a little topsy-turvy. I've changed courses (somewhat), and am now planning to work for <a href="http://www.replicalabs.com">Replica Labs</a>, the company I co-founded, full-time at the end of this school year.</p>

	<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
	<em>STEP Physical Assistant in Materials Science, <em>Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC </em>(January – December 2012)</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">As a STEP Assistant, it was my duty to maintain and organize lab equipment and research tools. In the course of my time there, I learned to operate the lab\'s laser and optic systems, both 355nm and 266nm beams. I had two main research goals: the accurate machining of research materials and creation of successful laser direct-write (LDW) samples for the NRL. I also assisted other group members in their projects.</p>
	<em>House Scholar, <em>George Washington University, Washington DC</em> (August 2011 - May 2012)</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I acted as a resource and mentor to students in my dormitory, as well as helped the University at large through service and event coordination. The position was less RA, and more guidance counselor to younger students.</p>
	<em><em>Software Intern</em>, Callahan and Associates, Washington DC (March - August 2011)</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I learned how to use and troubleshoot Callahan's patented software program Peer to Peer, which processed and presented data from United States Credit Unions to CEOs and CFOs, allowing for more effective analysis. Working with Peer to Peer helped me gain experience with Salesforce, SQL Server Management Studio, and HTML.</p>

	<h3>Education</h3>
	<em><a href="http://mlss2014.hiit.fi/index.php">Machine Learning Summer School</a>, Reykjavik, Iceland (April 24 - May 4, 2014)</em>
        <p class="square-small text-justify">A ten-day conference covering a wide array of Machine Learning techniques and applications, taught by some of the <a href="http://mlss2014.hiit.fi/speakers.php">world leaders</a> in the subject. It was an incredibly valuable experience, and helped me conceptualize several core concepts in statistics, control, inference, learning, and big data analysis. I would highly recommend the sources listed there to any researcher in the field; I myself took so many notes that I thought it would be best to write them all up in LaTeX, just to help me organize everything. Maybe one day I'll upload it...</p>
	<em>The George Washington University, Washington DC (August 2009 – May 2013)</em>
	  <ul>
	    <li>B.A. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Physics conferred May 2013. Physics thesis found <a href="/images/Physics_Thesis.pdf">here</a>.</li>
	    <li>Member and Student Advisor in the Honors Program</li>
	    <li>Cumul. GPA of 3.33/4</li>
	  </ul>
	  <em>James Wood High School,  Winchester VA (August 2005 – June 2009)</em>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Ranked 5th in class</li>
	    <li>Foreign Language Student of the Year for Japanese and Latin Studies</li>
	    <li>Cumul. GPA of 4.17/4</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h3>Teaching, Leadership, and Accolades</h3>
	  <i>Pitch George Competition</i>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">On Nov. 16<sup>th</sup>, 2013, I received 1<sup>st</sup> place for Graduate teams in the <a href="http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/student-entrepreneurs-shine-pitch-george-competition">Pitch George Elevator Pitch Competition</a> at GWU. My pitch was for a technology I called Replica, which created 3D printable meshes of objects on a mobile phone. The prize was $2000, and automatic placement into the semifinals of the GW Business Plan Competition.</p>
	<em>Tutoring</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I have been a STEM-focused tutor almost since I began my Undergraduate career. I was a volunteer tutor at the School Without Walls, Washington, DC for a year. I have also been a <a href="http://washingtondc.universitytutor.com/tutors/35811" target="_blank">private tutor</a> since January of 2010. Subjects that I have taught include Java, C, algebra, multivariable calculus, general physics, and Latin.</p>
	<em>Boy Scouts of America</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I received the Eagle Scout rank in Dec. 2008 for installing a weather station at Gainesboro Elementary School, Winchester, VA, and implementing an accompanying curriculum. I also received the Bronze Presidential Volunteer Service Award for service provided to the community. I know how to create some mean lashings.</p>
	<em>Ballroom Dance Society at GWU</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I was CFO of the (surprisingly large) organization from November 2009 – December 2010. I am a gold-level competitive collegiate dancer, and have performed and from everything from dance battles to Inaugural Balls. During my undergraduate time, I was also a ballroom instructor/mentor to both Newcomer and Bronze students. I was the winner of the 1st Annual Dancing with GW on February 2012, partnered with <a href="http://www.gwhatchet.com/2012/02/13/snapshot-139/" target="_blank">Prof. Melissa Keeley</a>.</p>
	<em><a href="http://physicsispeople.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Physics is People, Too</a></em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">A blog that I started that focused on how much science dominates in everyday life, and seeks to make the subject engaging for non-scientists. Kept up from June 2011 to February 2012.</p>

	<h3>Tools of the Trade</h3>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I have programmed (successfully, and in some cases, extensively) in the following languages:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>C/C++</li>
	    <li>Java</li>
	    <li>Python</li>
	    <li>Ruby</li>
	    <li>MATLAB</li>
	    <li>G-code</li>
	    <li>CSS</li>
	    <li>HTML (...that counts, right?)</li>
	  </ul>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">As one of my CS professors once said, every language can do what you tell it to; it\'s all just a matter of syntax. Most of my research is done in C++, though MATLAB is a damn fine analysis tool. I\'ve fallen in love with LaTeX, and will never write another Word document again*. And Photoshop is great for conveying those ideas that <a href="http://xkcd.com/722/">just don\'t fit into words</a>.</p>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I also highly recommend the <a href="https://github.com/bminortx/emacs-config">Emacs Configuration</a> put together by Jack Morrison. My life would be much harder without it.</p>
