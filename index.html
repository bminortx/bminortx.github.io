	<h4>STEP Physical Assistant in Materials Science</h4>
	<em>Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC (January – December 2012)</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">As a STEP Assistant, it was my duty to maintain and organize lab equipment and research tools. In the course of my time there, I learned to operate the lab\'s laser and optic systems, both 355nm and 266nm beams. I had two main research goals: the accurate machining of research materials and creation of successful laser direct-write (LDW) samples for the NRL. I also assisted other group members in their projects.</p>
	<h4>House Scholar</h4>
	<em>George Washington University, Washington DC (August 2011 - May 2012)</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I acted as a resource and mentor to students in my dormitory, as well as helped the University at large through service and event coordination. The position was less RA, and more guidance counselor to younger students.</p>
	<h4>Software Intern</h4>
	<em>Callahan and Associates, Washington DC (March - August 2011)</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I learned how to use and troubleshoot Callahan's patented software program Peer to Peer, which processed and presented data from United States Credit Unions to CEOs and CFOs, allowing for more effective analysis. Working with Peer to Peer helped me gain experience with Salesforce, SQL Server Management Studio, and HTML.</p></div>

	<h4>PhD -> Masters candidate</h4>
	<em>The University of Colorado at Boulder (August 2014 – present)</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I planned to continue my PhD studies in a new environment. However, I am dropping my candidacy to Masters in order to take a more formative role in Replica Labs.</p>
	
	<h4>PhD Candidate</h4>
	<em>The George Washington University, Washington DC (August 2013 – July 2014)</em>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I merged into the Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory (ARPG) as soon as I graduated from undergrad, under the guidance of Prof. Gabe Sibley. Here, I studied robotic path planning and computer vision. It was a good and challenging year; at the end of it, though, Prof. Sibley and the rest of the lab transferred to CU Boulder. I, naturally, followed.</p>
	
	<h4><a href="http://mlss2014.hiit.fi/index.php">Machine Learning Summer School</a></h4>
	<em>Reykjavik, Iceland (April 24 - May 4, 2014)</em>
        <p class="square-small text-justify">A ten-day conference covering a wide array of Machine Learning techniques and applications, taught by some of the <a href="http://mlss2014.hiit.fi/speakers.php">world leaders</a> in the subject. It was an incredibly valuable experience, and helped me conceptualize several core concepts in statistics, control, inference, learning, and big data analysis. I would highly recommend the sources listed there to any researcher in the field; I myself took so many notes that I thought it would be best to write them all up in LaTeX, just to help me organize everything. Maybe one day I'll upload it...</p>

	<p class="square-small text-justify">I became involved in robotics research in the Fall of 2012; before that, I had been intensely focused on materials science and nanotechnology.</p>
	<h4>Naval Research Laboratory</h4>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">Thorough application of Laser Direct-Write manufacturing, a technique developed through the NRL, I performed and became educated in both battery and electronics manufacturing. I also used and calibrated laser optic systems, profilometers, microscopes, UV lamps, spectrometers, and other vital pieces of research equipment for application in various projects.  </p>
	<h4>George Washington University</h4>
	<p class="square-small text-justify"><em>Analyses of Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures in Palladium Metal (<a href="http://robotics.gwu.edu/~bminortx/wp-content/uploads/Physics_Thesis.pdf">Thesis</a><em>, B.S. Physics, GWU)</em></em>. Project Advisors: Prof. Gerald Feldman (GWU), Prof. David Nagel (GWU), Prof. Scott Mathews (Catholic University). We used a femtosecond laser to create laser-induced periodic surface structures, i.e. LIPSS, on samples of palladium for potential materials applications. LIPSS have been the subject of several interesting case studies involving the micro-structuring and modification of materials. When shot with a short-pulse laser beam, a metal will bend and shape its surface according to the beams parameters, creating a periodic surface structure. We analyzed the results of femtosecond interaction with Palladium using a scanning electron microscope and MATLAB. The experimental parameters were the fluence of the laser and number of shots on a particular spot. LIPSS were not produced with our chosen parameters, but other structures were created that could still be of use in experiments influenced by surface modification, such as deuterium loading.</p>
  	<p class="square-small text-justify"><em>The Coffee and Cream Problem</em>: Physicists love coffee. Hot coffee, to be exact. Looking at our too-often lukewarm mugs, GWU\'s Prof. Gerald Feldman and I wondered: what\'s the best way to mix cream in one\'s coffee to achieve the hottest temperature for the longest time? This was an elegant experiment demonstrating Newton\'s Law of Cooling at a basic level. I used Logger Pro to demonstrate this effect on a cup of hot coffee (hot water) mixed with cool cream (cold water).  This project was presented at SESAPS 2011, as “The Coffee and Cream Dilemma”. I obtained a student award from the APS to travel to the conference in Roanoke, VA to present the poster.</p>

	<h4>Path Planning</h4>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">I am working on efficient methods to plan through a simulated environment using realistic physics. My main focus is currently Directed RRT, but there is plenty of opportunity for experimentation with other algorithms. The simulation is being implemented in C++.</p>
	<h4>MATLAB&lt;-&gt;Bullet Physics</h4>
	<p class="square-small text-justify">Using the Bullet Physics engine, I am developing a convenient MATLAB wrapper for dynamics simulation. The project is meant to become a quick and easy way to study complicated problems, allowing the user to work their mathematical magic in the convenience of MATLAB rather than C++.</p>
